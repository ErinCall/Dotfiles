# Hello! If you are editing this file, you need to make parallel edits
# to `.config/.gitignore`. Obviously you'd prefer to have
# `.config/.gitignore` be a symlink to this file. Unfortunately, it
# looks like git resolves the symlink, sees that it has already read
# this file, and doesn't re-apply its rules. At least, that's what I've
# inferred from observed behavior. :(
